        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>11 years ago nasa released curiosity, a SUV sized rover with rocket powered sky crane. This was a great achievement and roughly 1 year ago they did it again. In this article I will do an overview of the perseverance rover then compare it to the curiosity to see how much did nasa really improve in 10 years. </p>

        <h2>What has curosity found</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The curiosity rover has been a flagship mission for nasa, so of the achievements of the rover in the 9 years and 303 days that it has been on mars it has found evidence of previous liquid water, discovered that Mars has had the right chemistry to support living microbes having discovered nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon all the key ingredients that might lead to potential life. It also found organic carbon molecules, active methane in the atmosphere, and even found out that Mars once had a thicker atmosphere and more water. It also helped lay the foundation for future human missions to Mars by precisely measuring the radiation, finding that Mars's radiation environment is too high for human presence if not shielded </p>

        <h2>How will did persaverance land</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>All this is great but there is still plenty of science to be done and perseverance is doing it as you read. To begin with we will start with the project timeline for perseverance. The rover landed on mars feb, 18, 2021 via the Atlas V rocket with one of its most powerful configurations. It landed in Jezero crater. The location was chosen for its possibility of harboring life  in the past; it is believed that the crater was covered in water which may have the potential for fostering life in ancient times. The entry descent and landing system had a new technology called terrain relative navigation. This will allow a computer to scan a terrain during a descent and then compare it to an orbital map, and it will be able to divert to a safer landing zone. Another feature is the range trigger with a calculator when the parachute will be opened allowing the rover to land much closer to points of scientific interest </p>

        <p>Here is the timeline of events that happened for the rover to land on mars. At entry 10 minutes the cruise stage separates and burns up in the Martian atmosphere at entry plus zero minutes. At entry +80 seconds the heat shield experiences 2100 degrees celsius. At entry level +90 seconds the craft experiences the maximum declaration slowing down from 21,200 kilometers per hour to just 1600 kilometers per hour in only 2 and a half minutes at entry, + 240 seconds at an altitude of around 9 - 13 kilometers, the parachute deploys. At entry + 260 seconds shortly after the heat shield separates and falls to the marshall surface, the radar ground system will activate and begin scanning the Martian surface for a suitable touchdown zone. At around entry +350 seconds. The back shell separates and the rover begins a brief free fall the landing motors ignite. The Rover separates from the landing stage and is gently lowered to the ground on three nylon ropes. At this point, the craft has slowed down too, just 2.7 kilometers per hour. Finally, The rover touches down on the surface of mars and the landing stage that skycrane will fly away  from the rover before it crashes into the surface. This will begin perseverance’s mission.

        <h2>Changes between the rovers</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Now I will be covering the new and noteworthy stuff from perseverance and comparing it to curiosity. To begin with, the rovers are basically identical in design with perseverance using curiosities back up parts. Their dimensions are: 2.9m(width), 2.7m(long), and 2.2m(height). Although they are the same size, perseverance is heavier at 1050kg compared to curiosities 899kg. Both rovers use the same body which is called the WEB or the warm electronics box. It’s this strong outer layer that protects the computers and electronics as well as keeping them at a controlled temperature. On top of the web the deck is the large mast that houses the main cameras. Then there is the Mars environmental dynamic analyzer or known as the MEDA, which is basically a little weather station. On the bottom of perseverance is a sample collecting system. Perseverance will collect rock cores for future study with something else in the future picking it up. In the future they might make a new rover which will be like a small launch pad which will fire a small rocket into orbit because of mars’s thinner atmosphere and less gravity it will be easy to get something out of mars. These plans will probably not be carried out until 2028 therefore we will get these samples by 2030 at best. There is a new arm at the front of the roverfull of new science tools. It also has a corning drill and two science instruments alongside a color amer for close ups of the surface and inspections. Another change is the wheels of perseverance. It is designed to have a larger diameter and a smaller width than curiosities. These wheels should prevent the rover from egin stuck like perseverance did in 2014. Another big change is the fact that perseverance will carry 23 cameras to the surface including some that will film the journey into the martian atmosphere. The power system that perseverance will have will be the same as curiosities. A 45kg radioisotope thermoelectric generator or a RTG that converts heat of radioactive decay of plutonium into electricity. Along with the RTG There is also a pair of lithium ion batteries to help handle peak demands or times when the rover is using more energy than the RTG produces. The RTG is designed to last 14 years with a planned mission duration of 1.5 Mars years or 3 Earth years. An experiment that will be very useful for future missions to Mars will be MOXIE, which will be the first attempt to produce oxygen on the surface of mars. The final device the perseverance has isn’ regarding itself at all it is ingenuity. Which is a small drone helicopter It will show the concept of flight on mars and will give aerial images to better plan routes for perseverance. Ingenuity will capture images at about 10x better resolutions than orbital images. It is only 1.2 kg and its wings are 120 cm in diameter. It is expected to fly at least 5 times in its 30 day test with each flight only lasting 3 minutes.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The public is a huge part of these missions from naming the rover and the helicopter, entire instruments being built for our entertainment, and even printing 11 million names on the rover. This rover is made to make everybody happy and hopefully everyone will learn from this article.
