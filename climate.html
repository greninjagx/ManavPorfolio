        <h2>Black History Essay</h2>
        <p>This essay shows my listening skills as we had to write an essay based on the prentation of our peers.</p>
        <h3>Writing</h3>
        <p>While sacrifices are never easy, they are often necessary in order to achieve great things. This is true in the context of black history, where individuals have had to fight against overwhelming odds in order to make their voices heard.
Personal sacrifices are a vital component of achieving progress in black history.
For example, Martin Luther King Jr. was a key figure in the civil rights movement. His leadership and activism played a major role in advancing the cause of racial equality in the United States. However, King's achievements came at considerable personal cost, as he endured harassment, violence, and imprisonment in his fight for justice. King's sacrifices, and those of countless other activists, were crucial to the progress and success of the African American community. Without their courage and determination, many of the achievements we see in black history today would not have been possible. Their willingness to make personal sacrifices in the face of discrimination and abuse is a testament to their dedication to their cause. It is also a testament to their belief in the power of change. The sacrifices made by individuals such as King continue to inspire and motivate us to strive for progress and equality in our own lives and communities.
Booker T. Washington made significant personal sacrifices in his fight for equality.
Washington sacrificed his personal safety and reputation for advocating for racial progress. His famous Atlanta compromise speech in 1895, where he encouraged African Americans to pursue economic advancement instead of immediate political and social equality, ignited controversy within the black community. Despite the backlash, Washington continued to promote vocational education and economic empowerment for black Americans. Washington's achievements came at a high personal cost. He faced constant criticism and opposition from both black and white leaders, who accused him of being too accommodating to the white power structure. He also endured death threats and other forms of intimidation, and was even physically attacked on several occasions. Despite these challenges, Washington remained unwavered in his commitment to his cause and continued to work tirelessly to advance the interests of the African-American community. His sacrifices paved the way for future generations of black Americans to achieve broader opportunities and social mobility. His legacy continues to inspire and motivate us to strive for equality and justice for all.
Ruby Bridges made significant personal sacrifices in her fight for equality. At just six years old, Bridges became the first African American child to attend an all-white elementary school in the South. Her presence at the school was met with intense opposition from white parents. Bridges was escorted to school each day by federal marshals and endured verbal and physical abuse from white protesters. Bridges' bravery and determination came at a high personal cost. She faced constant harassment and intimidation from white protesters, who hurled racial slurs and objects at her as she walked to school. Despite the hostility and danger, Bridges remained committed to her education and her right to attend school with white students. Her actions helped to advance the cause of civil rights and racial integration, paving the way for future generations of black students to receive an equal education. Bridges' sacrifices continue to inspire us to stand up for what is right and just, even in the face of great adversity.
In conclusion, without incredible sacrifice, it is impossible to achieve remarkable things in black history. The sacrifices made by countless individuals throughout history have paved the way for the progress and success we see today. By honoring and recognizing these sacrifices, we can strive to work towards continued progress and equality for all people. The legacy of sacrifice in black history continues to inspire and motivate us to strive for a more just and equitable society. It is up to us to continue the fight for progress and equality for all.

        <h2>Debate and response</h4>
        <h4>Writing</h4>
        <p>In the 1850s, most of what makes a country good or not is its geography. Despite being the 6th largest country in the world, Australia has only gotten roughly 26 million people. To put that into context, the island of Java has 6x the population of Australia, even though it is 60x smaller than Australia. With this population, it's clear that Australia is not the best in a geographic sense. The only reason the British settled here was because America stopped taking convicts from the British in 1782. Therefore, the British started taking convicts to what is now Sydney.

Even though Australia is such a huge place, there were really only five places that would have been good for settlement, meaning they were beside the water for trade and control of the waterways of what comes in and goes out. These places are Perth, Adelaide, Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne. 85% of the entire population of Australia is in one of these cities or close to them, which is 0.01% of its land. An example of this is the East Pilbara Shire, which makes up the size of Japan and consists of 10,000 people. Or Anna Creek, which is the size of Israel but is just a private farm home to 12 people.

Another major city that is the capital of Australia is Canberra. This city was founded later and its location was chosen to be in between two major centers of population so as not to favor any of them. The simple answer to why Australia is not well-suited for large-scale human settlement is that it is covered in desert with dangerous animals and insects. Geographically, Australia is terrible since it is close to the frozen continent of Antarctica, meaning that there are currents coming up from the Southern Ocean which makes it impossible for large-scale evaporation. This then translates to no rain clouds and therefore no water for most of the west of Australia.

The Great Dividing Range is Australia's large and longest chain of mountains. The height of these mountains denies rainclouds the ability to move further into Australia other than the narrow strips of land in between the mountains. It is important to mention that these mountains aren't that big. In fact, Australia's average elevation is the lowest compared to any other continent. For comparison, ¾ of Colorado alone maintains an elevation higher than Australia's highest point. Therefore, as you can imagine, if you were invading Australia, you could almost strike from anywhere to a major city if you are not in a boat. Rain is so important in Australia that if you look at the annual rainfall averages and the population density, they are nearly identical. Except in northern Australia where the rain comes all at once.

The most significant river system is the Murray Darling Basin, which isn't great for a big civilization. The basin is on the south coast, which means that most of the basin exists in the part of the Australia beyond the Great Dividing Range that doesn't have a lot of rainfall. As a result, the average annual flow of the waters in the basin is just 24,000 gigaliters per year, which is 22x less than the Mississippi Basin. Nonetheless, this is the best Australia has and it gives 3 million Australians water, and the area around it is the heartland of agriculture. In Australia, only 6% of the land is arable, which can make it hard for farming.

Australia was actually founded by a Dutch boat in 1606 but was abandoned since they couldn't find any inhabitable land. When the British permanently settled in Australia, they only had 650,000 people, whereas Asia had 650,000,000 and Europe had 150,000,000 people. And growth in the</p>

        <h4>Student council speech</h4>
        <h4>Writing</h4>
        <p> Hello everyone, as you all know, I will now offer you the reasons why I would like to be the class representative for 7/8i this year. For those who don't know me, my name is Manav and I have been attending this school for three years. What a three years it has been! I have had numerous experiences and encounters that many people in the younger grades are now experiencing. I have grown so much in the past three years and it would be an honor and a privilege to represent this class as a leader. I am confident that I would be a positive influence on my peers. I am well-mannered and quite approachable, both in and out of the classroom. I am familiar with the qualities that this role requires, such as responsibility. By this, I mean a leader needs to be able to stay on top of the current state of the assignments they are assigned, and to be able to take what most students think is already a lot, and find valuable time for something as important as this. Kindness is another quality a leader must have; a leader will have to take on feedback from others and answer with kindness. You will not get very far as a leader if you believe others are below you. Transparency is also a key quality a leader must possess; a leader must be able to not only know their limitations, but also admit their shortcomings. Although I am nowhere close to being a perfect human being, I know that these qualities are some that I thrive at. With this knowledge of myself, I can firmly say that I will be able to give all I have to the student council, because it would be my biggest pleasure to be able to face the challenges and hope to make a difference.</p>
<h4>Why is it strong</h4>
<p>This writing is well-structured. I have clearly stated their reasons for wanting to be class representative and has highlighted the qualities they possess that would make me a good leader. I have also acknowledged their imperfections and their willingness to work on them. The language is clear and easy to understand. Overall, I beleive it is well written.</p>
