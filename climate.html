        <h2>IB application</h2>
        <p>One of the most important writing that I did this year would probably be the RLCP applications therefore I think it shows some of my best writing. </p>
        <h3>Writing</h3>
        <p>Cybersecurity may sound like a niche issue; it encompasses numerous impactful challenges - from fraud, privacy, cyber bullying, to addiction.
Canadian Anti Fraud Centre(CAFC) reports Canadians lost $379 million in 2021 to fraud. Already in 2022, the figure has exceeded $420 million. 68,076 frauds were reported in 2021. The CAFC confirms only 5-10% of victims report fraud; therefore, if we use the median, 7.5%, we will have 907,613 victims and over $5 billion in losses. Fraud doesn’t only affect the older generation. In fact, hackers target the younger generation because the younger generations share more information. Evidence for this comes from my family. Infomation my father used online had been hacked. A scammer applied for a credit card in his name, lowering his credit score. Cyberfraud can affect even tech-savvy individuals.
A person who never shares anything online, doesn’t have any social media accounts. Is this person susceptible to cyber fraud? Answer is YES..! But how? I learned Data aggregators, and corporate hacking are some of the most common methods, but corporate itself can be a fraud. An example of data aggregators is Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. This is particularly common with Facebook since they were collecting information from all websites that had their like button. Corporations we use on a daily basis have reported hacking like Netflix, LinkedIn, Bell, etc. The most impactful data breach I found was Equifax. Over 650 million people's personal information was stolen. A corporation itself that is fraudulent is FTX. Anyone who invested in crypto through FTX will lose their investment. In total, 67 billion dollars are expected to be lost.
The top solution to this problem is awareness as said by computer security expert Schneier “Amateurs hack systems, Professionals hack people”. Another solution is to teach people how to securely discover data and websites on the web. Communicate privately and anonymously using IM and email. Manually use end-to-end encryption for privacy.
My peers and I can build awareness campaigns, such as engaging websites like I built for the UFT hackathon, create YouTube videos similar to Jim Browning, create presentations and share them with my school, while also creating a technology club to teach about the TOR network and browser using Qubers OS. The IB Program would be beneficial because I would be around like-minded, motivated students. It will take time to solve this problem. IB students will make a difference, so in that environment we can work together to create a safer community.
 Sci-Tech has shown me that motivated students will stay on task while providing valuable feedback. An example of this is Destination Imagination. For this 6-month project, we developed a wood car of 150 grams that supported a weight of 10kg. I led the team and used their strengths for a great result.
Cybersecurity is broad, and I hope while in the IB program, I will spread the information to an even broader audience.
</p>
        <h3>Writing take away's</h3>
        <p>The writing is strong, it presents a clear argument on the importance and scope of cybersecurity, providing statistics and examples to support the points made. I also present potential solutions and shows their personal interest and experience in the field, as well as the potential benefits of the IB program in terms of spreading the information to a wider audience. The text is well-structured, with clear transitions and a logical flow of ideas. Overall, the writing is clear and persuasive.</p>

        <h2>Debate and response</h4>
        <h4>Writing</h4>
        <p>In the 1850s, most of what makes a country good or not is its geography. Despite being the 6th largest country in the world, Australia has only gotten roughly 26 million people. To put that into context, the island of Java has 6x the population of Australia, even though it is 60x smaller than Australia. With this population, it's clear that Australia is not the best in a geographic sense. The only reason the British settled here was because America stopped taking convicts from the British in 1782. Therefore, the British started taking convicts to what is now Sydney.

Even though Australia is such a huge place, there were really only five places that would have been good for settlement, meaning they were beside the water for trade and control of the waterways of what comes in and goes out. These places are Perth, Adelaide, Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne. 85% of the entire population of Australia is in one of these cities or close to them, which is 0.01% of its land. An example of this is the East Pilbara Shire, which makes up the size of Japan and consists of 10,000 people. Or Anna Creek, which is the size of Israel but is just a private farm home to 12 people.

Another major city that is the capital of Australia is Canberra. This city was founded later and its location was chosen to be in between two major centers of population so as not to favor any of them. The simple answer to why Australia is not well-suited for large-scale human settlement is that it is covered in desert with dangerous animals and insects. Geographically, Australia is terrible since it is close to the frozen continent of Antarctica, meaning that there are currents coming up from the Southern Ocean which makes it impossible for large-scale evaporation. This then translates to no rain clouds and therefore no water for most of the west of Australia.

The Great Dividing Range is Australia's large and longest chain of mountains. The height of these mountains denies rainclouds the ability to move further into Australia other than the narrow strips of land in between the mountains. It is important to mention that these mountains aren't that big. In fact, Australia's average elevation is the lowest compared to any other continent. For comparison, ¾ of Colorado alone maintains an elevation higher than Australia's highest point. Therefore, as you can imagine, if you were invading Australia, you could almost strike from anywhere to a major city if you are not in a boat. Rain is so important in Australia that if you look at the annual rainfall averages and the population density, they are nearly identical. Except in northern Australia where the rain comes all at once.

The most significant river system is the Murray Darling Basin, which isn't great for a big civilization. The basin is on the south coast, which means that most of the basin exists in the part of the Australia beyond the Great Dividing Range that doesn't have a lot of rainfall. As a result, the average annual flow of the waters in the basin is just 24,000 gigaliters per year, which is 22x less than the Mississippi Basin. Nonetheless, this is the best Australia has and it gives 3 million Australians water, and the area around it is the heartland of agriculture. In Australia, only 6% of the land is arable, which can make it hard for farming.

Australia was actually founded by a Dutch boat in 1606 but was abandoned since they couldn't find any inhabitable land. When the British permanently settled in Australia, they only had 650,000 people, whereas Asia had 650,000,000 and Europe had 150,000,000 people. And growth in the</p>

        <h4>Student council speech</h4>
        <h4>Writing</h4>
        <p> Hello everyone, as you all know, I will now offer you the reasons why I would like to be the class representative for 7/8i this year. For those who don't know me, my name is Manav and I have been attending this school for three years. What a three years it has been! I have had numerous experiences and encounters that many people in the younger grades are now experiencing. I have grown so much in the past three years and it would be an honor and a privilege to represent this class as a leader. I am confident that I would be a positive influence on my peers. I am well-mannered and quite approachable, both in and out of the classroom. I am familiar with the qualities that this role requires, such as responsibility. By this, I mean a leader needs to be able to stay on top of the current state of the assignments they are assigned, and to be able to take what most students think is already a lot, and find valuable time for something as important as this. Kindness is another quality a leader must have; a leader will have to take on feedback from others and answer with kindness. You will not get very far as a leader if you believe others are below you. Transparency is also a key quality a leader must possess; a leader must be able to not only know their limitations, but also admit their shortcomings. Although I am nowhere close to being a perfect human being, I know that these qualities are some that I thrive at. With this knowledge of myself, I can firmly say that I will be able to give all I have to the student council, because it would be my biggest pleasure to be able to face the challenges and hope to make a difference.</p>
<h4>Why is it strong</h4>
<p>This writing is well-structured. I have clearly stated their reasons for wanting to be class representative and has highlighted the qualities they possess that would make me a good leader. I have also acknowledged their imperfections and their willingness to work on them. The language is clear and easy to understand. Overall, I beleive it is well written.</p>
